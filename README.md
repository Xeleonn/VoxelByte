# VoxelByte

VoxelByte is a lightweight 3D voxel engine written in **C++** using **OpenGL**.  
Itâ€™s designed as a foundation for experimenting with voxel rendering, chunk management, and real-time world generation.

## Features

- Basic voxel rendering
- Chunked world system
- Camera & input controls
- Expandable voxel ID / property system
- OpenGL + GLSL shader support
- Modular code structure for future features

Planned / Roadmap:
- Greedy meshing & mesh optimizations
- Lighting & shadows
- Texture atlas & multiple block types
- World persistence (save/load)
- Physics & collision detection
- Multithreaded chunk generation
