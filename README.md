# VoxelByte

VoxelByte is a real-time voxel engine that supports high-performance rendering of 3D voxel-based environments using OpenGL. 
The engine includes a wireframe rendering mode for visualizing chunk structure and spatial density. 
The interface provides real-time debug info, adjustable chunk colors, and camera controls for inspecting voxel data. 

This screenshot shows a 128x128 voxel chunk rendered in wireframe mode with interactive settings and camera positioning.
